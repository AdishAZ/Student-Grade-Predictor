# **Problem Statement**

Traditional report cards only show marks, which do not fully represent a student’s overall performance. Factors like attendance, assignment completion, improvement, consistency, and extracurricular activities are often ignored. There is a need for a tool that can analyze these multiple aspects and provide meaningful feedback to help students understand and improve their academic performance.


# **Scope of Project**

This project aims to develop a Python-based Student Grade Predictor & Performance Analyzer that evaluates academic performance using marks, attendance, assignments, improvement, and extracurricular scores. The tool generates a performance score, gives a rating, and provides personalized suggestions to help students improve.


# **Target Users**

* Students who want to understand their academic performance better
* Teachers who want a quick assessment tool
* Parents tracking their child’s progress
* Schools or coaching centers providing performance analysis
* Educational project submissions for learning Python


# **High-level Features**

* Analyzes performance using multiple parameters (marks, attendance, assignments, etc.)
* Calculate a numeric performance score
* Generate a clear rating (Excellent, Good, Average, etc.)
* Provide personalized improvement suggestions
* Beginner-friendly command-line interface.
